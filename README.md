Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning Spam email classification is a critical problem in email management systems, as the growing volume of unsolicited and harmful emails continues to pose risks to users and organizations. This project aims to develop an efficient system for classifying emails as either spam or non-spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques.

Problem Statement: With the increasing number of spam emails, traditional rule-based methods of email filtering are becoming less effective. This project addresses the challenge of improving spam detection by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and ML algorithms to automate and optimize classification accuracy.

Objectives:

To explore and implement various NLP techniques for feature extraction from email content. To develop a robust spam classification model using popular ML algorithms. To evaluate the performance of the model using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Methodology: The project employs a dataset of labeled emails, which includes both spam and non-spam emails. Key steps include:

Preprocessing the email data, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Extracting features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent the email text in a format suitable for ML models. Implementing and training multiple ML algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify emails. Evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation and key evaluation metrics.
